# Playing-Breakthrough

The To play the game on a different-sized board, just fill the two front and two back rows with pieces; the board does not have to be square.[1]

Choose a player to go first; then play alternates, with each player moving one piece per turn.

A piece may move one space straight or diagonally forward if the target square is empty. A piece may move into a square containing an opponent's piece if and only if that square is one step diagonally forward. The opponent's piece is removed and the player's piece replaces it.

The first player to reach the opponent's home row — the one furthest from the player — is the winner. If all the pieces of a player are captured, that player loses.

This project playes breakthrough as a zero sum mini max game with alpha pruning.
